              Still, as sparsely populated as it was in the 1600's, this is an
              extraordinary and highly underrated state full of rich history and
              majestic natural beauty. Maine is the main state you want to be
              sure not to miss. As your journey is going to be a long one, you

              settlers on US territory in the era of the Vikings, but it is also
              home to L.L. Bean, which is a great company to grab a super sturdy

              There's no better place to lose yourself in nature than in
              springtime in New Hampshire. As serene and beautiful as it was in
              the 1700's, this state is still much less traveled that its

              You wont be on your bike the whole time, so doesn't it make sense
              to pick up some extra footwear? Fortunately for you, the best
              outdoor shoe company in the history of the world proudly hails
              from this state. Cycle by the Timberland headquarters in Stratham,
              and pick up a pair of rugged, waterproof boots to keep your feet
              dry. Fitting for unpredictable weather you may be confronted by
              while passing through the Appalachians. Theses boots are also

              Not only famous for "The Big Apple," the state of NY also has
              several other reasons for going down in history. Since the late

              your bicycle to help you see through those dark lonely roads on
              your adventure. Such a light from GE would set you back about

              Erie, Pennsylvania, not to be confused with the word "eerie,"
              although it can be from time to time, is another town worth
              passing through for several different reasons. While it might be

              From the college capital of Columbus to the clean coastline of
              Cleveland, Ohio is a truly hidden gem. Earthquakes are

              over 200 of which have registered a magnitude of 2 of higher since
              1776. However, Earthquakes aren't the only thing skaing this
              centrally located state. One of the country's largest and oldest
              roller coaster parks is waiting to ROCK your world in Sandusky,
              Ohio! This will presumably be one of the most thrilling quests
